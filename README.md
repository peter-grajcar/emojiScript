# emojiScript

emojiScript is programming language based on emojis. The interpreter of emojiScript is written in javaScript.

Here is a simple example of emojiScript code:

	🏃
		🏃
			😄 👉 2✖5❤️
			✏️(😄)❤️
		🔚❤️
	🔚🏁
	
Ouput:

	10

Every program starts with 🏃 and ends with 🔚🏁 similarly to Pascal's `BEGIN` and `END.`.


Variable value assignment in emojiScript is done by 'hand' like this `{variable}` 👉 `{value}`.


In emojiScript instead of semicolons, we use hearts ❤️❤️❤️❤️
